# Todo App with API Integration

This is a simple Todo application that implements state management using JavaScript and interacts with a RESTful API. The app allows users to manage their tasks, including adding, marking as done, filtering, and removing completed todos. The app also retrieves and persists the data from an external API.

## Features

- **Display Todos**: Shows a list of all current todos retrieved from the API.
- **Add New Todos**: Input field and button to add new todos, ensuring no duplicates.
- **API Integration**: Interacts with a RESTful API to fetch, create, update, and delete todos.
- **Done Status**: Checkboxes to mark todos as done.
- **Duplicate Check**: Prevents adding duplicate todos by checking against existing entries in the API.
- **Filter Todos**: Allows filtering todos by "All", "Open", or "Done".
- **Remove Done Todos**: A button to remove all completed todos via the API.
